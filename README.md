This project investigates migration patterns in Portugal from 2008 to 2021, aiming to analyze trends and changes. It utilizes data visualization to make complex migration data understandable and explores age group distribution and the origin of immigrants, ultimately addressing key questions about the evolution and characteristics of migration in Portugal during this period.


The main goal of this project is to answer these two questions:   

* How did the migration flux in Portugal evolved throughout the years between 2008 and 2021?
* How is this flux characterized throughout this timeframe? 
    - How is migration distributed between age groups? 
    - How is immigration distributed between different origin countries?
 

#### Data Source
This study used three datasets about the topic migration, collected from the website “PORDATA: 
dados estatísticos sobre Portugal e europa”. For more details, please refer to the documentation.
